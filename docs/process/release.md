# Setting Up Local Repository

1. Clone the Angular-CLI repo. A local copy works just fine.
1. Create an upstream remote:

```bash
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/angular/angular-cli.git
```

# Caretaker

The caretaker should triage issues, merge PR, and sheppard the release.

Caretaker calendar can be found [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=angular.io_jf53juok1lhpm84hv6bo6fmgbc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles).

Each shift consists of two caretakers. The primary caretaker is responsible for
merging PRs to master and patch whereas the secondary caretaker is responsible
for the release. Primary-secondary pairs are as follows:

| Primary | Secondary |
| ------- | --------- |
| Alan    | Doug      |
| Charles | Keen      |
| Filipe  | Joey      |

## Merging PRs

The list of PRs which are currently ready to merge (approved with passing status checks) can
be found with [this search](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22PR+action%3A+merge%22+-is%3Adraft).
This list should be checked daily and any ready PRs should be merged. For each PR, check the
`target` label to understand where it should be merged to. You can find which branches a specific
PR will be merged into with the `yarn ng-dev pr check-target-branches <pr>` command.

When ready to merge a PR, run the following command:

```
yarn ng-dev pr merge <pr>
```

### Maintaining LTS branches

Releases that are under Long Term Support (LTS) are listed on [angular.io](https://angular.io/guide/releases#support-policy-and-schedule).

Since there could be more than one LTS branch at any one time, PR authors who want to
merge commits into LTS branches must open a pull request against the specific base branch they'd like to target.

In general, cherry picks for LTS should only be done if it meets one of the criteria below:

1. It addresses a critical security vulnerability.
2. It fixes a breaking change in the external environment.
   For example, this could happen if one of the dependencies is deleted from NPM.
3. It fixes a legitimate failure on CI for a particular LTS branch.

# Release

For each version to be released, check out the associated branch and:

1. Increment the CLI version number in
   [`package.json`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/package.json).
1. Update `Angular` version in
   [`packages/schematics/angular/utility/latest-versions.ts`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/schematics/angular/utility/latest-versions.ts)
   to match the lastest framework patch version for the associated minor.
   - This number _usually_ aligns with the CLI version **but not always**. Framework may have
     required a hotfix release, which could desync the two version numbers. Check the latest version
     with `yarn info @angular/core dist-tags` or look at the most recent FW release in the
     [#news channel](https://angular-team.slack.com/archives/C0439GUGA).

As commits are cherry-picked when PRs are merged, creating the release should be a matter of creating a tag.

```bash
git add packages/schematics/angular/utility/latest-versions.ts package.json
git commit -m 'release: vXX'
git tag -a 'vXX' -m 'release: tag vXX'
```

The package versions we are about to publish are derived from `version` in the root
[`package.json`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/package.json#L3). Double check that the versions are correct by running the
following command.

```bash
yarn admin packages --releaseCheck
```

Now push the commit and the tag to the upstream repository. **Make sure to use
`--follow-tags`, as tags need to be pushed immediately or CI may fail!**

```bash
git push upstream --follow-tags
```

## Authenticating

**This can ONLY be done by a Google employee.**

Log in to the Wombat publishing service using your own github and google.com
account to publish. This enforces the login is done using 2Factor auth.

Run `npm login --registry https://wombat-dressing-room.appspot.com`:

1. In the new browser tab, the registry app will ask you to connect with GitHub to create a token
1. After connecting with github, you will be redirected to create a token
1. Upon redirect, an auth token is added to your ~/.npmrc for the proxy

After closing the tab, you have successfully logged in, it is time to publish.

**NOTE: After publishing, remove the token added to your `~/.npmrc` file to logout.**

## Publishing

**This can ONLY be done by a Google employee.**

**Wait for CI to be green after pushing the release commit.**

For the first release of a major version, follow the instructions in
[Publishing a Major Version](#publishing-a-major-version) section.

For non-major release, check out the patch branch (e.g. `9.1.x`), then run:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/ && yarn install --frozen-lockfile # Reload dependencies
yarn admin publish --tag latest
```

If also publishing a prerelease, check out `master`, then run:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/ && yarn install --frozen-lockfile # Reload dependencies
yarn admin publish --tag next
```

If also publish an LTS branch, check out that patch branch (e.g. `8.3.x`), then
run:

**Make sure to update the NPM tag for the version you are releasing!**

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/ && yarn # Reload dependencies
yarn admin publish --tag v8-lts
```

## Release Notes

`yarn run -s admin changelog` takes `from` and `to` arguments which are any valid git
ref.

For example, running the following command will output the release notes on
stdout between v1.2.3 and 1.2.4:

```bash
yarn run -s admin changelog --from=v1.2.3 --to=v1.2.4
```

Copy the output (you can use `| pbcopy` on MacOS or `| xclip` on Linux) and
paste the release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/releases)
for the tag just released.

If you have an API token for GitHub you can create a draft automatically by
using the `--githubToken` flag. You just then have to confirm the draft.

> **Tags containing `next` or `rc` should be marked as pre-release.**

## Post-release

Don't forget to update the Slack [#tools](https://angular-team.slack.com/archives/C46U16D4Z) channel
topic with the next caretaker shift from the
[calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=angular.io_jf53juok1lhpm84hv6bo6fmgbc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles).

## Publishing a Major Version

For the first release of a major version, say `v10.0.0`, checkout the major branch
(i.e. `10.0.x`), then run:

```bash
yarn # Reload dependencies
yarn admin publish --tag next # a major release is always tagged as next initially
```

Confirm with downstream repositories (Components, etc) that everything is ok.
Once the release is stable, wait for Framework to retag their packages, then
retag the CLI packages as `latest`.
The command below will automatically retag stable packages as well as experimental
packages.

```bash
yarn admin dist-tag --version 10.0.0 --tag latest
```

## Changing shifts

If you need to update the
[caretaker calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=angular.io_jf53juok1lhpm84hv6bo6fmgbc%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles)
to modify shifts, **make sure you are logged in as your @angular.io account** and
click the "+ Google Calendar" button in the bottom right to add it to your Google
Calendar account. You should then be able to find and modify events on
calendar.google.com. The calendar is a part of the `angular.io` organization, so
events can only be modified by users in the same organization.
